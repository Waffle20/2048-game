# 2048 Game in C with ncurses
Developed a console-based version of the 2048 game using C and the ncurses library. Implemented a custom game loop, real-time input handling, and dynamic menu navigation with options for New Game, Resume, and Quit. Designed efficient logic for tile movement, merging, and score tracking while ensuring smooth user interaction. Added features such as automatic moves after inactivity (using timers and nodelay), a simple AI-driven “best move” algorithm, and color-coded visual feedback for each tile. Implemented persistent state management to allow game resumption and integrated mechanisms to detect game-over and win conditions.
